# SpaceX Launch Map

## Description
  
  For this project we worked as a team to create a website for space enthusiasts. The user can search for missions by flight number and will be presented with a map showing the location the flight launched from as well as an information card displaying info about the mission. We used fetch requests to get the information we wanted to display from the SpaceX API and appended that information to a card that is created in our JavaScript file. We also used the SpaceX API to recieve the latitude and longitude of the launch to display the launch site with the Leaflet Map API. The website will save the users search history in local storage and create buttons for past searches to create a search history. If the user wants to search for the most recent launch they can click the "Get Latest Launch" button.
